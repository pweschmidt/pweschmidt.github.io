      <p>Life rarely follows a straight line doesn’t it?
Mine certainly hasn’t. 
Starting off as a physicist in research (particle and medical physics) I quickly realised 
that understanding and developing software is essential to successful research.</p>

<p>Alas, <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk">Research Software Engineering</a> as we know it today (at least in the UK) did not exist.
And since I was more and more drawn into creating software solutions it was only logical to join organisations that
focus on software development.
Enter the 2nd part of my career, which started in 2000 in the private sector. 
Since then I had the immense privilege to join a number of exciting teams and companies - and lately academia again - working 
on a range of different technologies.</p>

<p>Having worked in the IT sector for a long while, I am keen to share my experience and knowledge with others. 
One way of doing this is to engage in and promote open source software, open data and open science.</p>

<p>Another is podcasting. In Jan/2021 I launched a podcast called <a href="https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com">Code for Thought</a> to help
promote the role of research software engineers and look behind the scenes of what they are up to.</p>

<p>Using podcasting and similar media for community building and sharing knowledge is very exciting. And I hope to
produce more of it in future.</p>

</ul>

<p>The journey never ends and I am currently looking for other (part-time/temporary) opportunities.
After 25 years in the UK, and having both German and British citizenship, I am considering to relocate 
to either France (Paris) or back to Germany.</p>
