    <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
      <p>If someone had told me only four years ago, that I would
try to make a living with podcasting, I would have laughed straight into their faces. 
But then, life rarely follows a straight line or pattern.</p>

<p>It all started with a degree in particle physics from the Universität of Hamburg, Germany. Physics is what I wanted to do in my life and after finishing my thesis, I started as a Research Fellow
for a British Heart Foundation research project in medical physics and imaging in London. A role I sincerely hoped would lead to a permanent job.</p>

<p>Alas, most of research funding (still) is temporary and after a couple of extensions it was necessary to look elsewhere.</p>

<p>At this point, I already spent a considerable amount of time on computer programming (at the time Fortran, C++ and Java), and some on system administration (VMS on VAX from Digital Equipment, Sun OS, FreeBSD, Linux…). The term research engineering did not exist, yet. It was just something a PhD student or post-Doc would do in the course of their work. Most of it was self-taught and only some of us had prior hands-on experiences with computers. I did not.</p>

<p>However, by the time the research project did end in the year 2000, I got enough work practice and knowledge to seek a role in the private sector. Not as a physicist. But as a software engineer.</p>

<p>I got lucky. My first role, as senior software engineer no less, was with Sony Broadcasting and Professional at their UK offices in Basingstoke. To say I learnt a lot would be an utter understatement. There, I experienced - and was able to experiment with - different software development methodologies (e.g. eXtreme Programming), languages and learnt what it takes to work as an effective development team.</p>

<p>It was also an important lesson from a different perspective: it taught me, that changing your career path is not only possible, but also doable. This is despite all the obstacles, risks and the fact that you get little encouragement.</p>

<p>With that in mind, my career took another turn in 2012, when I decided to move into mobile app development. 
Two years before, I started to play with developing iOS and Android apps. 
And in 2011 I launched an app, <strong>iStayHealthy</strong>, to support people living with HIV in managing their chronic condition. The app did reasonably well on the AppStore (it is discontinued). 
As an enthusiastic mobile device developer and user, I had the necessary boost to go for a role as iOS developer at Alfresco. And, after cutting my teeth there, I moved on to Elsevier to help them with the Mendeley iOS app and build a mobile development team.
Elsevier is well known as a science publisher. Maybe less so as a tech company. But interesting work gets done there and I had the privilege to meet and work with a number of fascinating and inspiring people.</p>

<p>But then something happened in 2018: a colleague of mine recommended joining a Slack channel (we were all using Slack in the office) called <strong>RSE</strong>. RSE stands for Research Software Engineering. And it was the first time I heard about it. There was even a charity for that (whose Slack channel it still is). I joined and found a number of interesting discussions. I believe I even joined an open HPC (high performance computing) community call once, just to get a flavour of what’s happening.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity I looked up the ‘jobs’ channel in summer 2019. Imperial College and University College London were looking to fill <strong>permanent</strong> roles for Research Software Engineers (RSE). Both intrigued me and I decided to apply for the role at UCL.
At this stage I was well out of academia for nearly 20 years and reckoned my chances would be negligable. But to my surprise I got the interview, then the role.
And so, on 2 December 2019, I started my new career. Back in academia. Back in research. And then…</p>

<p>…Covid-19 struck. And everything changed. 
Everybody was in lockdown. We were all working from home. And keeping teams together and keeping communication lines up and running became vital. 
Even more so for a community, such as research software engineers, which is still relatively new.</p>

<p>In June 2020 I joined forces with Vanessa Sochat, who was then at Stanford University in the US. 
Vanessa has been running a podcast called <strong>RSE Stories</strong> (now called <strong>Developer Stories</strong>). Luckily, she took a chance on me and let me produce and co-host a bunch of episodes on the show in summer and autumn 2020.</p>

<p>Engineering and podcasting are really different beasts. And producing podcast episodes was (and is) definitely pushing me out of my comfort zone. But I also love doing it!</p>

<p>Mad perhaps, but in 2021, I decided to launch <strong>Code for Thought</strong> as a podcast for researchers, scientists, software engineers and anyone interested in this space. 
Running both a podcast and doing a full-time RSE job at UCL was getting difficult and so in 2022 I reduced my UCL working hours to free up time for podcasting. Which worked initially.</p>

<p>But at the beginning of 2023 I faced a choice: listener numbers were going up and podcast production took up more and more time. I saw an opportunity to strengthen the podcasting effort. But not while I keep working as an RSE at the same time. Something had to give. And it was my job at UCL that did.</p>

<p>And so, in June 2023, I ended my role as research software engineer at UCL and started a new chapter in my career: as a podcast host and producer for podcasts in Research, Science and Software Engineering.</p>
