# Beurre Manié
This is not a dish in its own right. Rather this butter/flour paste is used to thicken sauces.
Butter and flour are no strangers to sauce thickening. 
An alternative method is what Germans would call a "Mehlschwitze" (sauteed flour). 
There, you melt the butter in an empty pot, add the flour, which quickly thickens it into a thick paste and then slowly pour liquid into it, while vigorously stirring

With beurre Manié it's almost the other way round. You have the liquid already in the pot, hot and cooking. You then add the butter/flour paste while stirring continuously. 

Hope that makes sense...


## What you need
- ca 50g butter
- ca 40-50g flour (plain or potato)

### Equipment
- a fork
- a small bowl

## How to do it

- soften the butter (not liquid)
- put the butter into a bowl and then add the flour
- with a fork press the flour into the butter and that way mix it until it becomes a paste. You might have to use your fingers to do it
