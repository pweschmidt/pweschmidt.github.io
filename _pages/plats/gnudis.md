# Gnudis ricotta épinard (au beurre de sauge)

## What you need
- 200g spinach leaves
- 250g ricotta cheese
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 egg
- 40g flour
- 80g butter
- a leaf of sage (optional) 
- a pinch of nutmeg
- salt, peppe
- ca 50g parmesan cheese 

### Equipment

- a sieve
- a saucepan with lid
- a frying pan
- a bowl
- knive, cutting board

## How to do it

- wash the spinach and let it dry in the sieve
- peel and cut the garlic into thin slices
- add the butter to the sauce pan and heat it up. Add the garlic slices. When they are about to turn brown add the spinach and stir quickly so that all of the leaves get covered in the butter
- In the meantime: clean the sieve and add the ricotte into it so it can drain. Then put the drained ricotta into the bowl
- clean the sieve again. Take the spinach off the cooker and pour the content into the sieve. Let it drain and cool down.
- when the spinach is cooled down, put it on a cutting board and slice and cut it into small pieces
- add it to the bowl with the ricotta
- grate the parmesan cheese and add it to the bowl along with the egg, the salt and pepper and a pinch of nutmeg
- either mix by hand or use a kitchen mixer
- with your hands, take the dow and take small chunks of the size of a wallnut. Roll it in your hands and put aside. Dust the gnudi dumplings with a bit of flour. Repeat until you used all of the dough.
- clean the saucepan and fill with water. Add a little bit of salt to it
- Heat the saucepan/water until it boils. When it does, reduce the heat to a simmer.
- add the gnudis to the simmering water. They should drop to the bottom. After 5 minutes or so they should rise to the top again.
- take the cooked gnudis out of the pot and put them aside.
- put butter into the frying pan and heat it up. 
- make the cooked gnudis a bit flat on top/bottom so they look more like little donuts
- add the gnudis to the frying pan and brown them.

Bon Appetit
