# Coq au Vin

## What you need
- ca 200g pancetta
- a whole chicken
- olive oil
- ca 50g butter
- ca 40-45g plain or potato flour
- a pack of chestnut mushrooms
- 2 onions
- 2 carrots
- 2 garlic cloves
- thyme branches
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 bottle of Pinot noir red wine
- a tablespoon of balscamic vinegar
- 1 teaspoon of sugar
- ca 100ml Cognac
- salt and pepper

### Equipment
- cutting board
- big casserole
- frying pan
- a bowl 
- a ladle 

## How to do it

- first cut the chicken into chunks using a butchers knife or scissor. salt the chunks a little bit on all sides
- dice the pancetta
- put 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil into the casserole and heat it up
- when hot, add the pancetta to it. While stirring cook it until it becomes slighty brown. Then transfer the dices to a place, keep the oil/liquid in
- next add the chicken pieces into the casserole and cook them until they are slightly brown on all sides. Then transfer them to the plate with the pancetta
- add the onions into the casserole and cook until at least translucent
- add the sliced carrots and garlic and cook until they get soft. garlic shouldn't turn brown
- add the 50-75ml of Cognac and cook for 2-3 minutes
- add the 200ml chicken broth, the plum tomatoes with juice and the bottle of Pinot Noir. Add the fresh thyme and bay leaves. Also add the balsamic vinegar and sugar. Stir and mix well. 
- cook for 15min with the lid open
- In the meantime, use the frying pan to cook the sliced chestnut mushrooms until soft
- add the mushrooms and the chicken, pancetta to the casserole
- Cook it all for ca 45min with the lid 2/3s on
- In the meantime, use a small bowl and 50g butter and roughly the same amount of plain flour or potato flour. The butter should be soft so you can mix it all together into a paste
- After the 45min, add the butter/flour paste gently to the sauce and stir gently. The sauce should thicken.
- Cook for another 10-15min.
- Flavour with salt/pepper as desired

I think this works well with mashed potatoes and green beans or peas.
