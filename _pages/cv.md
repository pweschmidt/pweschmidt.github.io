## Short Bio
I was born in Nuremberg, Germany (Bavaria). In 1986 I moved to Hamburg, where I completed my physics degree first with a Diploma in 1990 and then with a Ph.D. in experimental particle physics in 1996, both from the University of Hamburg.

After a year working as a post-doc at the University of Hamburg on the Crystal Barrel experiment at CERN, I applied successfully for a research fellowship in medical physics/imaging at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London, UK. 

I have been living in London since then (1997).
