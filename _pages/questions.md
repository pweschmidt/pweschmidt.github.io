In this section, I try to answer some of the questions you might have with respect to how
I produce and distribute podcasts and podcast episodes. If your question is not being answered below, please contact me via [email](mailto:code4thought@proton.me).

## What's involved to produce an episode and how long does it take?
It takes on average 4 to 5 days to produce an episode end to end. This includes:
- preparation, development and research
- scripting, recording
- editing, post-production and publishing

## What's the final product?
The final product will be a digital audio file in either MP3 or WAV file format. 
I record and produce only audio data.

Platforms like YouTube have become more popular as an additional way to distribute podcasts. 
On demand, I can create a digital video file in MP4 format. This would include the digital audio data and a still image (e.g. the logo of the podcast with title of episode - see the Code for Thought [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@code4thought) channel). 

I do not record video. 

## Where to publish it?
This depends on your needs:
- as digital audio files, they can be published anywhere on a website. This could be an option, if you wish to make episodes available internally for your organisation. 
- if you have an existing podcast show, you can publish the episode directly there.  
- if you want make it publicly available, but do **not** have a podcast show, yet, I could help setting one up
- if the episode falls within the scope of the Code for Thought podcast, I will publish it there

## How much does it cost?
I have a fixed price for producing an episode end to end. 
Please contact me via [email](mailto:code4thought@proton.me) to find out more. 

If we agree, that it is necessary to travel and attend events (conference, workshop etc) to produce an episode, I would kindly ask to be reimbursed for the extra costs (travel, accomodation, registration fee).

## Can I sponsor and support the Code for Thought podcast?
Absolutely. A good way to sponsor this podcast is via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/codeforthought). This can be done on a regular (e.g. monthly) basis or a one-off payment.
If you want to support the show in other ways, [email](mailto:code4thought@proton.me) me. 

## What about tax and insurance?
I am operating as a sole trader and no extra taxes need to be added.
The work is insured with a Professional Indemnity insurance, and a copy of the insurance schedule is available on request.

## How does interviewing recording online work?
- I prefer to meet with podcast interviewees informally (online or face to face if requested) to
  - discuss the scope of our conversation
  - let people know what to expect on the day of the recording and how the whole process works
  - let them know what happens after the recording
- For online recording, I use [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com)
  - **NOTE**: Zencastr only works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave browsers
- During the recording, we will have video enabled (this helps the conversation). However, recordings will be **audio only**. 
- For the recording, please use an external microphone, e.g. a headset with microphone. Using the built-in microphones of your laptop is a bad idea, as it will capture all of the environmental noises. 
- Recorded episodes will be in WAV or MP3 format. I will typically not share the original, raw data with you, unless requested.

## How do face to face interviews work?
- As above, I'd like to meet interviewees informally before the recording to scope the discussion. This can be done online (or face to face).
- If the interview is to take place at your workplace, it would help if you could have a room, which is quiet(er) to reduce the background noise during the recording. 
- We would need to agree in advance if you require me to travel (beyond normal commuting distances) for the interview and extra costs (travel, accomodation) may incur. 
- I will bring the audio equipment for the recording. 

## How many people can I record at the same time?
I did record panel discussions for the Code for Thought podcast. In practical terms, I can record up to 6 people (including myself) at one sitting. 
- **face to face** recording mixer has space for 6 microphones
- **online** in theory I can invite more people to an interview. However, with more than 5 interviewees it becomes difficult to go through a recording and keep it interesting and useful for listeners.
