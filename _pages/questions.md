# Why podcasting
For many years, podcasts have been an incredibly popular medium and millions of people listen to it every day. Although, there are some special interest podcasts, most of them are aimed at news, entertainment, sports and culture. However, podcasts are also useful for:
- community building and strengthening
- training and education
- public engagement for research projects

# How can podcasting help in training
A few years ago I started to learn French from scratch and did all the usual things, i.e. going to language classes. However, I struggled to make any progress with learning from the course material alone. Be it, that it is very limited, be it that it is sometimes just not interesting.
A friend then suggested I should try listening to French podcasts. I may not understand much at first. But it helps getting the sound, rhythm and feel for the language. 
It helped. A lot.

And I wanted to see if this concept of using podcasts as additional material can be extended to technical and research subjects. Together with the Universe-HPC project we developed a mini-series of training sessions called "ByteSized RSE", where each session is accompanied by a podcast episode. The episode is adding additional material to the class, therefore giving students and listeners a different perspective on the subject.

Augmenting classes with podcast episodes can be a great concept for training courses.

# How does the interviewing and recording work?
- I prefer to meet with podcast interviewees informally (online or face to face if requested) to
  - discuss the scope of our conversation
  - let people know what to expect on the day of the recording and how the whole process works
  - let them know what happens after the recording
- For **online** recordings I use [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com)
  - **NOTE**: Zencastr only works with Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave browsers
- For face to face recordings, I will provide a recording device/mixer. 
- Recordings will be **audio only**.
- Share the edited version of the episode with them before it will go live. Interviewees may request changes to the episode, within reason. However, they can decide whether the episode can go live or not.
- the edited versions will be shared via a Dropbox link. There is no need to be a user for Dropbox. 
- Episodes will be filed as
  - WAV files for **audio** (previously MP3)
  - MP4 files for **video** - where the video will only consist of a still cover image, since no video is being recorded.


# How many people can I record at the same time?
I did record panel discussions for the Code for Thought podcast. In practical terms, I can record up to 6 people (including myself) at one sitting. 
- **face to face** recording mixer has space for 6 microphones
- **online** in theory I can invite more people to an interview. However, with more than 5 interviewees it becomes difficult to go through a recording and keep it interesting and useful for listeners.

# As an interviewee, what do I need?
- **face to face**: in short - nothing. If the interview happens to be at your work location it would help if you could reserve a room, which is relatively quiet.
- **online**: a headset with microphone, which is what most people have. When in Zencastr, make sure (in the Settings) that the input is set to the microphone and the output to your headset. 
  - I would **NOT** recommend to use the microphone from your laptop and computer, as this will ultimately capture background noises and feedbacks. 

# How does podcasting work
A crucial element is a protocol called [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org), which stands for Real Simple Syndication. It is a form of notification service, allowing web-sites to "register" with a content provider. Each time the provider updates their website, the "clients" get notified with an **RSS feed** containing some essential metadata. 

In short there are 2 parts:
- the content provider, i.e. a web-site hosting your content (audio MP3, WAV files)
- the podcast directory, where your podcast can be registered to make it available and promote to the public. The most popular ones are Apple Podcast, Spotify, Google Podcast, Podcast Addict. It usually pays to register your podcast with multiple directories

You can create your podcast hosting website yourself, e.g. with GitHub or GitLab pages. However, there are a number of excellent podcasting platforms available that take a lot of the work away and let you get valuable features like
- scheduling of episode publishing
- comprehensive analytics
- registering with different podcast directories

There are a number of solutions available, e.g. Acast, Podbean etc. 
I am using [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

# How much effort is involved
An end to end production of a podcast episode usually breaks down like this:
- preparation and subject research. This includes 
  - looking for and arranging for invites with potential interview partners
  - developing a story/narrative for what is being presented
- recording of the episode(s). This depends on how the episode is structured. If it is an interview based episode, one recording (the interview) will suffice. If it is a report-style episode, several recordings may be needed.
- editing. No matter how good a public speaker you and your interview partners believe to be, you will need to edit your audio material. 
- post-production. I usually treat this separately from editing. Post-production includes putting all the edited versions of your material together into a coherent episode. This also includes the metadata associated with the episode (episode notes) and any announcements you make on "social" media. 
- publishing. depending on your Podcast host platform this can be as simple as clicking the publish button. You can then use the prepared announcements and share them on your media platforms
