# End to end production of an episode
Producing an episode end to end takes 4 days on average.

This includes:
- preparation, research and scripting
- audio recording, editing, postproduction
- publishing of the episode
  - if the episode is to be part of the Code for Thought show
  - otherwise, I can publish/schedule episodes if appropriate access and privileges are provided for the podcast host
- help and advice to create a podcasting host

Price per episode:
- £/€ 1,100.00 
- $ 1,300.00

Prices can be negotiated. Please, [email me](mailto:code4thought@proton.me).

# What is the final product?
- A podcast episode will be in form of a digital audio file. By default, the WAV file format will be chosen. If requested, MP3 files can be produced as well. 
- Decription of the audio (episode notes). Transcription can be provided, if requested (**English only**). Clients may decide to provide their own episode notes.
- If the podcast is published to a Video platform such as YouTube, the file format will be MPEG-4. **NOTE** recordings are audio only. By default, I will produce a video "still" based on the podcast logo. 


# Additional costs?
There are two types of additional costs that may occur:
- **Travel**: if we agree that I need to travel to produce an episode, I would kindly ask for the travel and accomodation costs to be reimbursed. 
- **Registration fees**: this is for conferences, workshops etc. If the work entails producing a conference/workshop report, I would kindly ask for the registration fees to be either waived or reimbursed.
Any additional costs will need to be approved in advance. 

# Is the work insured?
Yes, I hold a professional liability insurance. A copy of the current insurance schedule is available on request. 

# Tax?
As a sole trader under UK law, no tax needs to be added.

# Not provided
- Running of the podcast hosts. As mentioned above, I can advise on how to create and run a podcast host and help where needed. However, the client would be responsible for running the podcast host services including any payments that may incur.
- Collaborators will need to purchase their audio equipment, if needed.
