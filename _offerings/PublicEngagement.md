Podcasts are a great way to bring your important research work to the attention of a wider public.
Sadly, we live in times, where research work is at times undervalued, rejected or simply ignored (see discussions around climate change and vaccines). And I believe that explaining what we do and why has become more important than ever.

Of course, there are popular science podcasts out there. However, with such a huge research output every year, the big stations can only skim the surface and tend to focus on widely known and popular researchers and research programs. 

At the same time, I think it is important to give all researchers an opportunity to share their work with the wider public. 

With that in mind, I am thrilled to work with the [linguistics team ](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/de/) at the Humboldt-Universit√§t in Berlin, Germany, since June 2023. The team have a list of exciting research on a wide range of themes around the use and effect of language in our daily lives. Together, we started a podcast (in **German**) called [Register Geknister](https://registergeknister.buzzsprout.com), which is available on all major podcast directories since August 2023.

If you like the idea of sharing your work using podcasts, please, do get in touch via [email](mailto:code4thought@proton.me).
