Together with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) and the [Society for Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org) in the UK, I launched the **Code for Thought** podcast to support and promote the growing community of research software engineers.

The show was launched with the first episode on 19 January 2021 **And so it begins...** and new episodes have been published regularly since then.

In March 2023, I launched a German language version of the podcast, with a report on the RSE Conference 2023 in Paderborn, Germany.

The podcast is available on most popular podcast directories including: Apple, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Podcast Index, Amazon Music, and others.

Since March 2023, the podcast is also available on YouTube (audio only):
