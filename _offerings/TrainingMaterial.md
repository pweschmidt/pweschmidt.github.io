The idea of using podcasts in training and education came to me when I started to learn French in 2018. In addition to attending French classes, a friend of mine pointed me to French podcasts (Radio France, France Inter). It is, he said, a good way of getting a feel for the language. And indeed, for me it has been a great way to extend my understanding and learning, while at the same time listening to interesting topics. 

I wanted to see, if we can extend this to training and education in other areas as well. And so, in autumn 2022, I started a collaboration with the [Universe HPC](http://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/events/byte-sized-rse/) project, led by Prof Neil Chue Hong and collaborators from Imperial College London and Southampton University. Together we developed the **ByteSized RSE** program. 
**ByteSized RSE** consists of short, selfcontained classes and exercise programs, accompanied by a short(ish) podcast episode.

The podcast episodes are currently published under the umbrella of the 'Code for Thought' podcast and are available on all major podcast directories and my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@code4thought) channel, for which there is an extra ByteSized RSE subscription.

Podcasting cannot replace teaching courses and classes. But they can be a valuable, additional resource for students as well as provide a good background source for people who were not able to attend.
